## Part #2 - Transformation and Projection method
Given some points in the .mat file, the following steps are implemented and demonstrated in the demo file:
- Translation
- Rotation
- Translation
- Calculation of the perspective projection for two different cameras

## Part #3 - Light Calculation and Rendering
- Calculate the ambient, diffuse and specular light
- Use the sum of them to paint an image using either Gouraud or Phong shading
- Calculate the normal vectors and the projection of the 3D object to 2D
